## ACMG-Compliant-Clinical-Report
### Variant Annotation and Clinical Report Generation Pipeline
This repository contains a Python script that integrates Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and Docker to annotate genomic variants and generate a clinical report based on the annotations and ACMG guidelines.

Features
Automates the setup and execution of the VEP Docker container.
Parses input VCF files and creates a DataFrame containing variant information.
Annotates each variant using the VEP Docker container.
Classifies variants based on ACMG guidelines and VEP annotations.
Generates a PDF report containing patient information and annotated variant details.
Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure that you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Docker (for running the VEP Docker container)
Python packages: vcf, pysam, pandas, fpdf

Customization
You can customize the variant classification logic by modifying the classify_variant function in the script. The current implementation is based on variant quality and VEP annotations.

Additionally, you'll need to implement the parse_vep_output function to parse the VEP output and extract relevant annotations based on the output format.

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation uses the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for variant annotation, it doesn't provide direct ACMG classification, and the ClinVar annotations were found to be empty after the annotation process.

To address this limitation and improve the variant classification capabilities, future enhancements to this pipeline will include the integration of ANNOVar, a widely used tool for functional annotation of genetic variants.

ANNOVar offers access to various annotation databases, including those providing ACMG classification information. By incorporating ANNOVar into the pipeline, achieving more accurate and comprehensive variant classification based on ACMG guidelines.

 note that the use of ANNOVar requires an institutional email address associated with a licensed copy of the tool. 

## Testing and Evaluation

The current implementation of the variant annotation and clinical report generation pipeline is a prototype and requires thorough testing and evaluation to ensure its reliability and accuracy.

While the code has been developed based on the provided requirements, it is essential to conduct rigorous testing with a diverse set of input VCF files and clinical scenarios to validate the output and identify potential issues or areas for improvement.

Some key aspects that require testing and evaluation include:

1. **Variant Annotation Accuracy**: Evaluate the accuracy of the variant annotations obtained from the VEP Docker container and compare them with known or validated annotations from other sources.

2. **Variant Classification Logic**: Thoroughly test the variant classification logic implemented in the `classify_variant` function to ensure that it aligns with the ACMG guidelines and produces accurate classifications based on the provided annotations.

3. **Report Generation**: Assess the generated PDF reports for completeness, readability, and adherence to clinical reporting standards.

4. **Performance and Scalability**: Test the pipeline's performance and scalability with large VCF files and evaluate its resource consumption (e.g., memory, CPU usage) to identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization.

5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling**: Thoroughly test the pipeline's behavior in edge cases, such as handling malformed or incomplete input data, and ensure proper error handling and logging mechanisms are in place.

Contributions from the community in the form of bug reports, test cases, and feedback are highly valuable and will help improve the robustness and reliability of this pipeline.
